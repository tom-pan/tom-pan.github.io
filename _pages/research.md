<div id="jmp" style="display: none; background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> Information provision has been a popular option in the experimenal literature. Unlike physical goods, 
information is easy to spread, causing concerns for spillovers. Such spillover can be important to gauge the effect of information provision. Intuitively, when neighbors 
have deep understanding about a policy, providing extra information may have diminshed effect. The treatment effect defined in this paper captures this idea by allowing the treatment effect to vary across the average neighbor 
outcomes. A nonlinear peer effect model is adopted to model the outcome and define such treatment effect. The simultaneity problem, which is further complicated by the nonlinearity, is solved by comparing agents with the same 
neighbors. The paper then constructs a non-parametric estimator for this treatment effect and the consistency of the estimator is established. Application of the proposed method to an anti-violence campaign illustrates the presence of 
considerable nonlinearities in the treatment effect.</div>


<ul><li><a href="" style="text-decoration:none" target="_blank">A Flexible Test for Homophily in Network Formation Models</a> 
<br> <a href="#/" style="color:black" onclick="visib('homop')"><em>Abstract</em></a> | <em></em></li></ul>

<div id="homop" style="display: none; background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px"> Various Studies have highlighted the role of homophily as a driver of network formation. Homophily 
refers to the idea that 'birds of a feather flock together'. The more general idea is that the difference in characteristics affect the network formation. However, when testing for the presence of 
homophily, researchers typically assume speciifc functional forms and distance measures for the difference in characteristics. However, economic theory provides little guidance on these assumptions and 
they can vary considerably across contexts. This paper provides a flexible test for homophily, imposing minimal assumption on the functional form of of link formation and the distance meausre. Homophily is 
characterized through derivatives of the conditional linking probability and the non-parametric density-weighted derivative is used to construct the test statistic. Asymptotic normality of the test statistic 
is established. A step-down procedure to select the homophilous variables among a set of variables is also constructed.</div>
